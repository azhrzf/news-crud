(61, 'Admin Example', 'Lionel Messi is not normal! Winners and losers as Argentina ace defies age, logic and Croatia to reach World Cup final', 'Wednesday, 14/12/2022', 'The Albiceleste captain scored one goal and created another, by destroying Josko Gvardiol, as Lionel Scaloni&#039;s side triumphed 3-0 in Lusail. How is Lionel Messi still doing this?! The man is 35 years of age. And yet he&#039;s back in a World Cup final after playing a pivotal role in Argentina dismantling Croatia in a rousing 3-0 win at the Lusail Stadium. In a record-equalling 25th World Cup appearance, Messi made yet more history, becoming the first man since records began in 1966 to score and assist in the same World Cup game for the fourth time.\r\n\r\nAnd what an assist!\r\n\r\nWith Argentina 2-0 up thanks to a Messi penalty and the luckiest great goal you&#039;ll probably ever see from Julian Alvarez, the diminutive No.10 tormented the highly-rated Josko Gvardiol on the right flank before cutting the ball back for his strike partner to score his second of the evening. The fans behind the goal immediately bowed before their god once more, and why wouldn&#039;t they? What Messi has already achieved in Qatar is super-human.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the help of Lionel Scaloni and a mix of exciting young talents and valiant veterans, he will have another chance to rewrite the record books on Sunday. His 26th World Cup appearance will be a final. He will have the chance to win the Golden Ball, the Golden Boot and the trophy that would remove any lingering doubt over the identity of the greatest player of all time.\r\n\r\nWINNER: Messi&#039;s penalty-taking\r\nLionel Messi&#039;s game is pretty flawless. However, his penalty-taking has never exactly been his forte. He&#039;s even missed one at this tournament, against Poland. However, his response to the setback has been as emphatic as the spot-kick with which he opened the scoring here.\r\n\r\nMessi has now scored three penalties at Qatar 2022 – only Eusebio (four for Portugal in 1966) and Rob Rensenbrink (four for Netherlands in 1978) have ever scored more at a single World Cup. Let&#039;s also not forget that Messi struck first for Argentina in their shootout success against Netherlands in the quarter-finals.\r\n\r\nSo, while it may seem strange to say, Messi&#039;s accuracy and composure from 12 yards have actually played a pivotal role in his country&#039;s progression to the final, as well as helping him become Argentina&#039;s all-time leading World Cup goalscorer (11), and move level with Kylian Mbappe in the race for this year&#039;s Golden Boot.\r\n\r\nLOSER: Josko Gvardiol\r\nSome top team is going to pay a massive amount of money to sign Josko Gvardiol in the not-too-distant future. He is an outstanding prospect, as he had already proven at Qatar 2022, Indeed, some had him down as the defender of the tournament. Probably not anymore, though. Very unfairly, the abiding image of Gvardiol&#039;s campaign will be the masked man being turned inside out by a 35-year-old forward, an outrageous passage of play from Messi that evoked memories of poor Jerome Boateng being wrong-footed to the point of collapse at Camp Nou a few years ago.\r\n\r\nThere is, then, no shame in being embarrassed by the greatest player ever to play the game, especially at the age of just 20, but that won&#039;t make this night of torment an easier for Gvardiol to forget.\r\n\r\nWINNER: Julian Alvarez\r\nBefore this game, there was no disputing that the luckiest solo strike in World Cup history was scored by Saudi Arabia&#039;s Saeed Al-Owairan at USA &#039;94. However, Julian Alvarez arguably produced an even better mix of great play and good fortune. Just like Al-Owairan, the Argentina No.9 was in midfield when he picked up possession and elected to run right at the opposition defence.\r\n\r\nAlvarez probably should have passed at a couple of points, but his directness paid off, as he was left with the simplest of volleys after the ball had ricocheted off not one but two Croatian defenders while barging his way into the area. One could also argue that Alvarez deserved his rub of the green, given he had already covered every blade of grass in the Croatia half, and also won the penalty with which Messi broke the deadlock, after making a perfectly-timed run in behind Josko Gvardiol &amp; Co.\r\n\r\nHis strike from Messi&#039;s remarkable second-half assist means he now has four World Cup goals. For a player who began this tournament on the bench, that&#039;s a pretty good return.\r\n\r\nLOSER: Luka Modric\r\nThis was just not Luka Modric&#039;s night, as so painfully illustrated by a ball being deflected into his face at one point in the second half. There were some typically terrific touches on the ball, particularly during the first half, when Croatia were hogging the ball. But Modric, for once, just wasn&#039;t able to bend the game to his well. He was never going to stop fighting, of course. The man&#039;s motto is &#039;Never. Give. Up&#039; but this eagerly-awaited battle of the iconic No.10s sadly proved a mismatch.\r\n\r\nModric is unlikely to play in another World Cup, but you never know. As Mateo Kovacic recently argued, his captain is so smart and so skilful that he could continue into his early-40s. Still, this felt like a last World Cup outing for Modric, so it was lovely to see him applauded from the field by the Argentina fans as he was replaced by Lovro Majer with 10 minutes to go.\r\n\r\nIt was a fitting show of respect for one of the game&#039;s greats.\r\n\r\nWINNER: Benfica&#039;s bank balance\r\nThe opening half of this match was ridiculously tense, an incredibly cagey affair between two evenly-matched sides. It needed something special to end the stalemate. Step forward Enzo Fernandez, who produced a sublime pass from deep to put Julian Alvarez in on goal. It&#039;s no exaggeration to say that the 21-year-old has completely transformed Argentina&#039;s midfield since bring brought into the starting line-up after his sensational strike against Mexico in the group stage.\r\n\r\nHere, he was helped no end by the industry of Leandro Paredes, but Fernandez is one of those players that can do it all. He is the quintessential game-changer and such players are rare in football. Indeed, while Argentina are presently celebrating the emergence of a player that will grace their midfield for years to come, Benfica will soon be laughing all the way to the bank after paying an initial €10 million (£8m/$9.8m) for a talent that will make them a small fortune whenever they decide to sell him.\r\n\r\nLOSER: Cristiano Ronaldo\r\nA penny for Cristiano Ronaldo&#039;s thoughts right now...\r\n\r\nPortugal&#039;s Qatar 2022 campaign was an absolute disaster for their captain, who was slated for both his poor performances and petulant behaviour, both which played a part in him being relegated to the bench for the games against Switzerland and Morocco. To top it all off, Messi, Ronaldo&#039;s great rival, is having an incredible tournament, and it&#039;s telling that people are no longer debating who is the better player between the Argentine and the Portuguese. The focus now going into the final will be on whether Messi will usurp Diego Maradona as the GOAT if he wins the World Cup on Sunday.\r\n\r\nLife really does come at you fast sometimes.', '63993cbd3b014.jpeg'),
(62, 'Writer Example', 'U.S. Poised to Send Patriot Missiles to Ukraine, Officials Say', 'Wednesday, 14/12/2022', 'WASHINGTON — The United States is poised to approve sending its most advanced ground-based air defense system to Ukraine, responding to the country’s urgent request to help defend against an onslaught of Russian missile and drone attacks, two U.S. officials said on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nDefense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III could approve a directive as early as this week to transfer one Patriot battery already overseas to Ukraine, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Final approval would then rest with President Biden.\r\n\r\nWhite House, Pentagon and State Department officials declined to comment on details of the transfer of a Patriot battery, which, if approved, would amount to one of the most sophisticated weapons the United States has provided Ukraine. The Patriot system can knock down Russia’s ballistic missiles, unlike other systems the West has provided, and can hit targets much farther away.\r\n\r\n“We have been very clear that the United States will continue to prioritize sending air defense systems to Ukraine to help our Ukrainian partners defend themselves from the brutal Russian aggression that we’ve seen for the better part of a year now,” Ned Price, a State Department spokesman, told reporters on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMany questions remain about the potential transfer, which was reported earlier by CNN, including how long it would take to train Ukrainian soldiers on the system, presumably in Germany, and where the Patriots would be deployed inside Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe United States had previously resisted providing the Ukrainians Patriot batteries, of which it has relatively few and which require sophisticated training.\r\n\r\nBut Ukrainian officials have intensified their pleas for air defenses from the United States and other Western allies as Russia has conducted relentless attacks on power plants, heating systems and other energy infrastructure. The attacks, using missiles and Iranian-made drones, have left Ukrainians vulnerable and in the dark just as the coldest time of the year is beginning.\r\n\r\nOver the weekend, Russian drone strikes on the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa plunged more than 1.5 million people in the region into darkness over the weekend. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said the strikes by Russia, part of a nationwide assault on Ukraine’s energy grid, had left the region in a “very difficult” situation, warning that it would take days, not hours, to restore power to civilians.\r\n\r\nIn a speech to the Group of 7 nations on Monday, Mr. Zelensky thanked the countries for their continued support but listed financing for weapons first among his requests.\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately, Russia still has the advantage in artillery and missiles,” he said. He requested additional artillery, as well as modern tanks — equipment that Ukraine has repeatedly asked for, along with fighter jets and longer-range missiles.\r\n\r\nThe decision to send the Patriot system would be a powerful sign of the United States’ deepening military commitment to Ukraine. The Pentagon’s active-duty Patriot units frequently deploy for missions around the world, and experts say the United States does not have the kind of deep stockpiles of Patriot missiles available for transfer that it did with munitions like artillery shells and rockets.\r\n\r\nCapable of being configured in a number of ways, a Patriot battery typically consists of one or more launchers, radars and vehicles for command and control of air defense operations.\r\n\r\nThe system uses three different models of missiles, according to experts at the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.\r\n\r\nOne, called the PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative, or CRI, can strike enemy warplanes, helicopter and cruise missiles at a range of about 40 miles and ballistic missile targets at a range of 22 miles. The second, called PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement, or MSE, can hit the same kinds of targets at ranges of 75 miles and 44 miles, respectively, the Missile Defense Project analysts said. The third, called Guidance Enhanced Missile-Tactical, or GEM-T, can destroy enemy aircraft about 99 miles away.\r\n\r\nIt is unclear which model or models of missiles the United States intends to send to Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe Pentagon previously provided Ukraine with two shorter-range air defense weapons called National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, or NASAMS, which arrived in November. The Pentagon is spending $1.2 billion for six more NASAMS to be built and delivered to Kyiv in the coming years. But NASAMS can strike targets only about a third as far as the Patriot system.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. military has deployed Patriot batteries in numerous conflicts since the early 1990s. In perhaps the weapons’ most recent combat use, U.S. Army soldiers at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates fired “multiple” Patriot interceptors at missiles headed toward the base in January, according to U.S. Central Command.', '6399450299060.jpg'),
(63, 'Writer Example', 'After Bankman-Fried’s arrest, Washington seeks answers — and distance', 'Wednesday, 14/12/2022', 'The sudden arrest of disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried ensnarled Washington on Tuesday, as Democrats and Republicans began to sort through the political wreckage — and looked to distance themselves from one of their chief benefactors in the 2022 election.\r\n\r\nFor years, Bankman-Fried had been a darling in the eyes of the nation’s political class: The crypto mogul had maintained a visible presence in the halls of the Capitol, a generous campaign checkbook and a close relationship with the regulators who oversaw his company.\r\n\r\nBut lawmakers came to find that Bankman-Fried presided over a deeply troubled enterprise, one whose flaws had eluded scrutiny in Washington until FTX declared bankruptcy last month. Then, mere hours before Bankman-Fried was supposed to answer Tuesday for his actions at a congressional hearing, federal prosecutors secured his surprise arrest in the Bahamas for eventual extradition to the United States — filing charges alleging he misled investors and mishandled billions in funds.\r\n\r\nThe news rocked Capitol Hill, where lawmakers in both parties blasted Bankman-Fried for his alleged crimes — and expressed fears about further, rampant abuse in the largely unregulated crypto industry.\r\n\r\n“My fear is that we will view Sam Bankman-Fried as just one big snake in a crypto Garden of Eden,” Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) remarked at the House hearing where Bankman-Fried had been due to appear. “The fact is, crypto is a garden of snakes.”\r\n\r\nFor others in Washington, the FTX founder’s arrest carried immediate political implications, since federal officials coupled their fraud charges against Bankman-Fried with allegations he conspired to commit multiple violations of campaign finance laws involving donations in the “tens of millions of dollars.”\r\n\r\nIn the two years leading up to last month’s elections, the crypto executive donated more than $40 million to candidates and campaign groups, according to federal records. Most of his money went to Democrats, though Bankman-Fried has alluded to additional, undisclosed contributions to Republicans. His publicly reported giving to Democratic-aligned groups was surpassed this election cycle only by that of George Soros, the liberal financier.\r\n\r\nTwo of Bankman-Fried’s biggest beneficiaries in 2022 were the House Majority PAC and the Senate Majority PAC, which help elect Democrats to their respective chambers. Those organizations alone received about $7 million from him over the past two years, federal data shows. Yet neither group — along with a raft of other Democratic and Republican organizations — would say Tuesday whether they planned to return the cash.\r\n\r\n“Anybody who received political contributions from this person ought to be worried about whether everything was aboveboard,” said Noah Bookbinder, chief executive of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW).\r\n\r\nThe scramble again laid bare the consequences of lawmakers’ own inattentiveness to the rise of cryptocurrency. Once a fad form of investing among a cadre of digital natives, the ecosystem of digital wallets, tokens and other tools has evolved into an increasingly powerful, profitable force — one shaping the country’s political and financial systems in real time.\r\n\r\nBefore its collapse, FTX had been the third-largest crypto exchange in the world by volume, amassing massive sums that its top executive, Bankman-Fried, allegedly misused in ways that brought down the company and others connected to its fortunes. In response, federal prosecutors indicted him on eight criminal counts Tuesday, while financial regulators — the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission — each brought civil charges.\r\n\r\nAs federal officials unfurled their allegations, lawmakers on Capitol Hill embarked on their own probe, despite Bankman-Fried’s absence. The scene was striking, coming one year — almost to the exact day — after the FTX founder last appeared in front of the same committee and promised to work alongside Congress to have a “positive impact on the world.”\r\n\r\nOpening the marathon gathering, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the powerful chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, said she was “deeply troubled to learn how common it was” for the former chief executive to “steal from the cookie jar” at FTX. She blasted Bankman-Fried for his impropriety, which allegedly included the use of company funds to pay for his “lavish” lifestyle.\r\n\r\nAcross the Capitol, Senate lawmakers prepared for their own hearing Wednesday — a session of the Banking Committee that Bankman-Fried had intended to skip before his arrest. Some panel members said they hoped the FTX scandal might inspire lawmakers to pay more attention to the nascent digital field.\r\n\r\n“I’m sure as heck glad we didn’t rush to some loose regulatory structure that would have potentially allowed crypto a legal way into our financial networks,” said Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), promising that he had “a lot of questions” for crypto executives in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nAnother panel member, Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), said lawmakers going forward needed to “fill the gaps where there are gaps,” adding: “You can’t gamble with your customers’ money. We need to make sure that applies to crypto exchanges, if [it doesn’t] already.”\r\n\r\nYet many lawmakers faced questions of their own, having benefited from the $40 million in Bankman-Fried’s known donations — and tens of millions more from other top executives at FTX. The problems were more than mere optics, since federal officials charged the former chief executive with multiple campaign finance violations. That included allegations that Bankman-Fried illegally sourced some of the funds from his related crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research, then reported the contributions in the names of others, according to the Justice Department.\r\n\r\n“All of this dirty money was used in service of Bankman-Fried’s desire to buy bipartisan influence and impact the direction of public policy in Washington,” said Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.\r\n\r\nFederal Election Commission regulations require that committees refund illegal contributions, including those improperly made in the name of another donor, within 30 days of the date on which the illegal giving was discovered. If the committees lack sufficient funds, they are required to use the next dollars they receive.\r\n\r\nThe charges came days after the watchdog organization CREW filed a formal complaint with the FEC, pointing to Bankman-Fried’s public comments that he had donated significant sums to “dark money” groups to elect Republicans. Such groups do not have to disclose their donors.\r\n\r\nIt is unclear to whom Bankman-Fried donated those sums, and the extent to which the organizations also may have broken the law in accepting them. Yet even those who received his money in more public-facing, legal forms found themselves grappling with whether they should keep it.\r\n\r\nTwo key lawmakers, Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and John Boozman (R-Ark.), on Tuesday confirmed their offices had donated or would donate the money they had received from Bankman-Fried to charity. The two had worked hand-in-hand with the now-disgraced crypto mogul on legislation seen as friendly to the industry.\r\n\r\nBankman-Fried also gave $6 million to the House Majority PAC, the main super PAC supporting House Democrats; $1 million to the Senate Majority PAC, which supports Senate Democrats; and more than $1 million to the Democratic National Committee and an allied group. And he gave $1.3 million to a super PAC backing Latino House candidates and $2 million to a super PAC supporting mostly Democratic candidates seen as friendly to cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nA spokeswoman for the Senate Majority PAC declined to comment about the cash from Bankman-Fried. Representatives for the other groups did not respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nBankman-Fried directed millions in contributions through Protect Our Future, a group that boosted candidates committed to pandemic preparedness and other causes under the umbrella of a philanthropic approach known as effective altruism. The former FTX chief has acknowledged in recent weeks that his philanthropy was shaped by business imperatives, saying in an interview at the New York Times DealBook Summit: “We thought about ourselves as legitimately trying to do good, but we also thought about what we could do to make sure that our image reflected that.”\r\n\r\nProtect Our Future gave to a broad array of candidates, party committees and left-leaning causes. Those ranged from a super PAC that backed Carrick Flynn, who ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for an open House seat in Oregon, to the campaign arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, the gun control advocacy group.\r\n\r\nThe Flynn-aligned super PAC did not respond to a request for comment. Max Steele, a spokesman for Everytown, said Bankman-Fried’s in-kind contribution took the form of polling conducted in the spring. He said there was no cash to return.\r\n\r\nAlong with Bankman-Fried, another FTX executive, Ryan Salame, gave publicly — and prolifically — to GOP groups, shelling out about $25 million in the 2022 election cycle. Representatives for the main GOP super PACs competing for control of Congress, which received money from him, did not respond to requests for comment. Salame also did not respond to an email seeking comment.\r\n\r\nBrad Deutsch, who served as general counsel to the 2020 presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), said groups have several options for handling “tainted money,” beyond seeking to return the cash to its source. They can disgorge the money to the Treasury Department, he said, or send it to charity.\r\n\r\n“We’re still very early in this story,” Deutsch cautioned. “For all we know, the funds are his personal funds. If I were advising a client, I would say it’s a PR thing. Put out a press release saying, ‘At the time we accepted, we had no idea of the alleged wrongdoing.’”\r\n\r\nEven before his arrest, though, some lawmakers had started trying to separate themselves from a man who had once been in their better graces.\r\n\r\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), who is set to become House minority leader in the next Congress, donated his contributions to the American Diabetes Association several weeks ago, according to an aide. Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) contributed his sums to a local food bank before Thanksgiving, the office said. And Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), a longtime crypto advocate, gave her donation last month to a nonprofit fighting poverty, according to a spokesman.', 'random'),

With club football booting back up and the World Cup coming to an end, Manchester United and what remained of the first team headed to Spain for a mid-season training camp and two-game tour.

We&#039;re trying to research and get him back.&quot;\r\n\r\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE: Sancho has only managed to impress in ebbs and flows since his £73 million move to Old Trafford in 2021. A slow first season showed signs of picking up in 2022, and after a promising start under Ten Hag, his form derailed completely and he found himself losing his place to 18-year-old Alejandro Garnacho. Since signing for United, Sancho has only managed eight goals and four assists from 52 appearances.', 'random');
