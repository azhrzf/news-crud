        <p style="color: white;">"But in order that you may see whence comes all this born error of those who accuse pleasure and praise pain, I will open the whole matter, and I will explain the very things which were said by that discoverer of truth and, as it were, the architect of a happy life. great sorrows result to those who do not know how to pursue pleasure with reason. Nor is there anyone who loves pain because it is pain, pursues it, wants to gain it, but because such times never occur when he seeks some great pleasure through labor and pain. For I will come to the smallest , which of us undertakes any physical exercise that is laborious, except in order that some advantage may result from it? But who can rightly criticize him who wants to be in that pleasure which results in no discomfort, or he who avoids pain in which no pleasure is produced?"</p>
